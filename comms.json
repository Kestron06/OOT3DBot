Please note you will still need to own a copy of OOT3D and a 3DS to dump it with. For a guide on how to do so, you can use `!dump`.","dump":"To dump a game ROM for use in Citra, you will need to follow the steps listed [here](<https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges>).

Heavy use of glitches may be required and it may be impossible to beat.\n- Vanilla: Play the game with all of the items in their usual locations, but with the other QoL upgrades the randomizer has to offer.\n\nFor help with different logic tricks, which add additional ways to attain item locations in the logic, you can visit [here](<https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Logic>).","log":"The spoiler log is a list of all settings and item locations.
